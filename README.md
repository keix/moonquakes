# Moonquakes
A clean Zig interpretation of Lua — not bound to its C past, but faithful to its spirit.

## Overview
Moonquakes is a clean-room implementation of the **Lua 5.4** virtual machine and runtime, written entirely in Zig.
It is not a binding to the official C implementation — instead, it aims to reimplement the key components of Lua with a clear,
modern design and a focus on readability, correctness, and hackability.
