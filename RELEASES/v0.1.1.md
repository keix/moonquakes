# Moonquakes v0.1.1 — Guarded Crescent

## Summary

This release stabilizes Moonquakes by establishing
a proper GC root model and fixing a segmentation fault
in REPL execution.

Moonquakes must not crash at the execution boundary.

## Changes

### VM

- Introduced temporary root stack (`temp_roots`)
- Marked temporary roots during GC
- Ensured closures are protected before GC is re-enabled

### REPL

- Properly initialized `_ENV` upvalue (upvalue[0] = globals)
- Protected closure execution with temporary roots
- Pre-interned `_PROMPT` key to avoid GC instability

### CLI

- Correct exit codes for `LuaException` and compile errors
- Improved error message propagation

## Notes

This is a stability patch following v0.1.0 "First Crescent".
